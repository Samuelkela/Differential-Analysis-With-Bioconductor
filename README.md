About this Dataset
Context
Maternal smoking has a severe negative effect on all stages of pregnancy that in consequence impairs fetal growth and development. Tobacco smoke-related defects are well established at the clinical level; however, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological conditions. Votavova et al employed a genomic approach to determine transcriptome alterations induced by maternal smoking in pregnancy. The investigators assayed gene expression profiles in placentas of pregnant smokers and those without significant exposure.

Content
The study provided microarray gene expression data that was sequenced using the platform Illumina HumanRef-8 v3.0 . I acquired the raw placenta gene expression data and phenotype data off the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. I performed quality control, normalization and summarization of the data using various packages in R. The feature data was acquired off of the Ensembl BioMart database.

In the study, placental samples were obtained from women who gave birth to a baby in the Ceske Budejovice Hospital from November 2008 to March 2009. All participants provided written informed consent and completed an extensive questionnaire on pregnancy history (medication, diseases), delivery course, newborn characteristics and life style (smoking, diet, alcohol drinking, area of residency).
